# eformuploadr

Shiny app for semi-manual processing and uploading electronic forms. 
Provides a simple graphical user interface for uploading electronic
forms to WQP.

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. Sensitive information
and development history have been removed but I have kept the
underlying infrastructure as a learning tool/reference/example.
**This package is not functional** because proprietary information
has been removed. Maybe someday I'll make this function as a demo...
someday...
